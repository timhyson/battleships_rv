Battleships representation built in Ruby and tested in RSpec.  Rebuilt from the ground up as an exercise in MVP.

BattleShips
The game is ready to play when there are two players initialized with a board each and each board has 5 ships placed.

By default it is player1's go first and after each shot it will switch the turns until there is a winner.

A game_setup.rb file has been added which sets up the game to a ready state placeing each ship from colums A through to E vertically.
