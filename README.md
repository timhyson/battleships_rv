Battleships representation built in Ruby and tested in RSpec.  Rebuilt from the ground up as an exercise in MVP.

#BattleShips

The game is ready to play when there are two players initialized with a board each, and each board has 5 ships placed. 

By default it is player1's go first and after each shot it will switch the turns until there is a winner.
